# Sleepy State Prediction

The "Sleepy State Prediction" project aims to address the critical issue of drowsy driving, a major cause of road accidents during late-night journeys. This project leverages cutting-edge machine learning and computer vision technologies to develop a robust system capable of predicting and alerting drivers when they are on the verge of falling asleep at the wheel.

## Objective
The core functionality of the system relies on machine learning models that continuously monitor the driver's eye movements and facial expressions. These models are designed to detect early signs of drowsiness, such as slow, heavy eyelid movements and eye closures. By analyzing these indicators in real-time, the system can provide timely alerts to the driver, helping them stay awake, focused, and, most importantly, ensuring road safety.

## Goal
This project's ultimate goal is to enhance road safety, reduce accidents caused by drowsy driving, and potentially save lives. Through the fusion of machine learning and computer vision technology, "Sleepy State Prediction" demonstrates the potential to revolutionize driver safety during late-night journeys and set a precedent for innovative solutions in the field of transportation safety.

## Implementation
The implementation of the "Sleepy State Prediction" project involves the following steps:

1. Data Collection: Gather a dataset of images/videos capturing various instances of drowsy and alert driving behavior.
2. Preprocessing: Preprocess the collected data to extract relevant features such as eye movements, facial expressions, and head positions.
3. Model Training: Train machine learning models, such as deep neural networks, using the preprocessed data to classify driver states as either alert or drowsy.
4. Real-time Monitoring: Implement a system that continuously monitors the driver's behavior using a camera installed in the vehicle.
5. Alert Mechanism: Develop an alert mechanism that triggers visual, auditory, or haptic alerts when drowsiness is detected, prompting the driver to take corrective action.

By following these steps, the "Sleepy State Prediction" project aims to deploy a practical solution that enhances road safety and prevents accidents caused by drowsy driving.
